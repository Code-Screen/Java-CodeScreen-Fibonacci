# Java-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen Java coding assessment that requires the candidate to write a method that returns the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with `fibonacci(0` returning 0 and `fibonacci(1)` returning 1.

The class to write this method in is [src/main/java/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculator.java](src/main/java/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculator.java).

The test cases that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in [src/test/java/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorTest.java](src/test/java/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorTest.java).

The test cases that are run and are hidden to the candidate are located in [src/test/java/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.java](src/test/java/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.java).
